Hello David!

Here you will find all the non finished projects I started this year! Hope that at least one of that will be useful in the future...

I could have done more maybe, but I think you will find somebody better than me at dealing with autocatalytic networks. I hope I was useful at least, during this year.

Let's talk about what you find in all these folders:

- Bounds_sensitivities contains the following:

	- Papers from Horowitz, Esposito, Owen. THE MASTERPIECES..
	- Latex Files, mainly the old and new version of the sensitivity overleaf. We should continue working on overleaf tho
	- The bad sensitivity jupyter notebook, just for the bounds images
	
- Conservation_laws contains the following:

	- Papers from Plasson et al.
	- Latex Files to compile the Conservation_Laws

- Consistency contains:

	- My notes on frustrating networks
	- The paper on consistent cycles
	
- Copasi contains:

	- The three simple networks as .cps files so you can simulate times courses, fluxes, sensitivities
	
- Escher contains:

	- The simple example .ipynb that has everything (if you know what you're doing) about how to represent a network with escher. + auxiliary files
	
- Invaders_realizations contains:
	
	- Papers and the old code that simulates different realizations (no invasions) to see the behavior of random autocatalytic networks. You can see linearity of the non autocat ones, eigenvalues, 					 		distribution of cores and growth rates...
	
- Successive_invasions contains:
	
	- Last important papers
	- Latex code for the INVADERS overleaf
	- The last code I worked with, the one on successive invasions, with affinities, currents, etc...
	
If you have any questions, you know how to contact me. It has been a really nice year, overall, and I hope you enjoyed working with me and that, somehow, I potentially contributed to some of the ideas you had. Thanks again for everything David. I will miss you!

Bests, Simone
